	    cpustat periodically dumps out the current CPU utilisation
	    statistics of running processes. cpustat has been optimised
	    to have a minimal CPU overhead and typically uses about 35%
	    of the CPU compared to top. cpustat also includes some simple
	    statistical analysis options that can help characterise the
	    way CPUs are being loaded.
